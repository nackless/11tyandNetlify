description: I came across eleventy while looking for ways to write my blog articles easier. I wanted to avoid using html tags for every article I write and also avoid repetitive code for every page. It was good old Kevin Powell's video which introduced me to using eleventy and how to implement it using netlify and netlify cms. This article is my attempt at simplifying what I learnt and at the same time, add some description about the things that I found challenging.

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) is a static site generator and claims to be a faster option as compared to many other static site generators. As mentioned, I came across eleventy through [Kevin Powell's](https://www.kevinpowell.co) YouTube video and have since fallen in love with it.

Although there are quite a few resources to learn eleventy, I felt there is a need for a even simpler one so someone like me can understand and create their own static site. I don't have any plans to dive into HTML and CSS here but I am happy to write about them in abother post if it will help my dear readers.

So, lets start.

Ingredients needed:

1. Knowledge of [git](https://git-scm.com "Git Webpage") and a [github](https://github.com) account (preferably)
2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en "Node download page") installed on the computer
3. A basic website made of HTML and CSS
4. A code editor
5. A few hours to sit and go through this material and implement it in your website

The first step before you begin is to either make a git repository or use one to get a website template. You should clone the repository to your local machine if you are using a template and can your terminal based git command or download github desktop if you prefer GUI.
